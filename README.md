# montecarlo_sphere
Calculating the hyper-volume of an n-dimensional sphere using Montecarlo methods in C++

The main program is main.cpp. Other files are libraries required to run the code, for which I provided a makefile.
I used a Montecarlo approximation method to find the hyper-volume, which turns out to be reasonably correct. The program can be easily modified to calculate the volume of any n-dimensional function or surface.
